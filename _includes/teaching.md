Students comments:

am so glad to have him as our TA this semester."*

*"He is the best TA I have met thus far"*

*"Very attentive and caring TA, is always willing to help and knows so much of the course."*

*"I thought the TA sections were much more valuable than the actual lecture. In fact, the TA seems like a better teacher than the prof. He
might not know the material as well as the prof at this time, but he's a much better teacher and I learned much more from him and his sessions."*

*"I learned more in the discussion sections than the lectures. The TA sections reviewed material for exams which was very helpful. It was
a combination of content and practice each session"*
