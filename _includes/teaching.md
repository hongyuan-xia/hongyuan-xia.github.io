  <li><em>"Very attentive and caring TA, is always willing to help and knows so much of the course."</em></li>
  <li><em>"I thought the TA sections were much more valuable than the actual lecture. In fact, the TA seems like a better teacher than the prof. He might not know the material as well as the prof at this time, but he's a much better teacher and I learned much more from him and his sessions."</em></li>
  <li><em>"I learned more in the discussion sections than the lectures. The TA sections reviewed material for exams which was very helpful. It was a combination of content and practice each session."</em></li>
